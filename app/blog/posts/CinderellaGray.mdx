First and foremost, try out the game. It's amazing.  
This is Uma Musume: Cinderella Gray,
an anthropormorphic version of Oguri Cap's legendary story. It's a sport anime that
animates Oguri Cap's journey from being in the regionals and then going to the nationals.

I didn't really have any expectations for this show, but I was really impressed from the start.
Right off the bat, we're introduced to Kitahara Jo, who is the main human of this story.
Immediately right after that, Oguri Cap is shown. I really enjoyed this setup that forsees
that these two would soon link. After the opening plays, it takes our mind off of Oguri and
shows Belno Light instead, who just transferred into Gifu Kasamatsu. Once again, Oguri
takes the spotlight again and displays Oguri's funny personality and her hidden potential.
That's where I got hooked, and they did it with only one episode.

I really enjoyed how early they established the main cast. Oguri, Belno, Kitahara, were all
enjoyable seeing them together. They then introduced who I thought was the villain for the rest of the show,
Fujimasa March. Another race goes by and Oguri wins it. Oguri does her "concert". I did like how they showed
this concert with the context of where they are at. From the game, the concerts in Tracen Academy were some big stage
idol concert, but here, reminder that's in the countryside of Kasamatsu, she has a small stage with awkward traditional music
showcasing a little bit of goofiness from Oguri. She also shows some character development where she begins
to question why she is running, a question all of us as viewers also wonder.

Fujimasa and Oguri both engage in their rivalry and pretty obviously Oguri wins. The win felt massive here but
it soon became the least of her worries. With someone as good as Fujimasa matching her, it kinda gets you wondering
just how much farther can Oguri push herself past her "Cap", and that opportunity is given to her right away but at the expense of leaving town.
Oguri takes the opporunity, and the real challenge begins.

Here, Oguri humbles many of the Tracen racers and it's pretty hype. They even include some of the racers
from the game here like: Sirius Symboli, Maruzensky, Sakura Chiyono O, etc. I would probably say the best episode is Episode 9.
That whole episode from start to finish was just chef's kiss. The whole illusion that Oguri was racing and that phenemenom being an actual event from real life
is just so awesome to me. Pretty inspiring that the JRA's Oguri Cap rule is also shown here too and even getting a glimpse
of T.M Opera O (a horse that was able to win the classics because of the rule).  
Aside from telling Oguri's story, I really liked how they also told Tamamo Cross' story. A horse who is also gray and were rivals, just screams absolute peak anime material.
